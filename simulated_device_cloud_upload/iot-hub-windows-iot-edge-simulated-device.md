# Use Azure IoT Edge to send device-to-cloud messages with a simulated device (Windows)

## Install the prerequisites

1. Install [Visual Studio 2015 or 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com). You can use the free Community Edition if you meet the licensing requirements. Be sure to include Visual C++ and NuGet Package Manager.

1. Install [git](http://www.git-scm.com) and make sure you can run git.exe from the command line.

1. Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and make sure you can run cmake.exe from the command line. CMake version 3.7.2 or later is recommended. The **.msi** installer is the easiest option on Windows. Add CMake to the PATH for at least the current user when the installer prompts you.

1. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-27). Make sure you add Python to your `PATH` environment variable. Go to **Control Panel** > **System and Security** > **System** > **Advanced system settings** > **Environment Variables**. Add `C:\Python27` to your path. 

1. At a command prompt, run the following command to clone the Azure IoT Edge GitHub repository to your local machine:

    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/iot-edge.git
    ```

## How to build the sample

You can now build the IoT Edge runtime and samples on your local machine:

1. Open **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2015** or **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017**, depending on your version.

1. Navigate to the root folder in your local copy of the **iot-edge** repository.

1. Run theÂ build script as follows:

    ```cmd
    tools\build.cmd --disable-native-remote-modules
    ```

This script creates a Visual Studio solution file and builds the solution. You can find the Visual Studio solution in the **build** folder in your local copy of the **iot-edge** repository. If you want to build and run the unit tests, add the `--run-unittests` parameter. If you want to build and run the end to end tests, add the `--run-e2e-tests`.

> [!NOTE]
> Every time you run the **build.cmd** script, it deletes and then recreates the **build** folder in the root folder of your local copy of the **iot-edge** repository.

## Run the sample

The **build.cmd** script generates its output in the **build** folder in your local copy of the **iot-edge** repository. This output includes the four IoT Edge modules used in this sample.

The build script creates the following files:

* **logger.dll** in the **build\\modules\\logger\\Debug** folder.
* **iothub.dll** in the **build\\modules\\iothub\\Debug** folder.
* **identity\_map.dll** in the **build\\modules\\identitymap\\Debug** folder.
* **simulated\_device.dll** in the **build\\modules\\simulated\_device\\Debug** folder.

Use these paths for the **module path** values as shown in the simulated\_device\_cloud\_upload\_win JSON settings file.

The simulated\_device\_cloud\_upload sample process takes the path to a JSON configuration file as a command-line argument. The following example JSON file is provided in the SDK repository at **samples\\simulated\_device\_cloud\_upload\_sample\\src\\simulated\_device\_cloud\_upload\_win.json**. This configuration file works as is unless you modify the build script to place the IoT Edge modules or sample executables in non-default locations.

> [!NOTE]
> The module paths are relative to the directory where the simulated\_device\_cloud\_upload\_sample.exe is located. The sample JSON configuration file defaults to writing to 'deviceCloudUploadGatewaylog.log' in your current working directory.

In a text editor, open the file **samples\\simulated\_device\_cloud\_upload\\src\\simulated\_device\_cloud\_upload\_win.json** in your local copy of the **iot-edge** repository. This file configures the IoT Edge modules in the sample gateway:

* The **IoTHub** module connects to your IoT hub. You configure it to send data to your IoT hub. Specifically, set the **IoTHubName** value to the name of your IoT hub and set the **IoTHubSuffix** value to **azure-devices.net**. Set the **Transport** value to one of: **HTTP**, **AMQP**, or **MQTT**. Currently, only **HTTP** shares one TCP connection for all device messages. If you set the value to **AMQP**, or **MQTT**, the gateway maintains a separate TCP connection to IoT Hub for each device.
* The **mapping** module maps the MAC addresses of your simulated devices to your IoT Hub device Ids. Set the **deviceId** values to the Ids of the two devices you added to your IoT hub. Set the **deviceKey** values to the keys of your two devices.
* The **BLE1** and **BLE2** modules are the simulated devices. Note how the module MAC addresses match the addresses in the **mapping** module.
* The **Logger** module logs your gateway activity to a file.
* The **module path** values shown in the following example are relative to the directory where the simulated\_device\_cloud\_upload\_sample.exe is located.
* The **links** array at the bottom of the JSON file connects the **BLE1** and **BLE2** modules to the **mapping** module, and the **mapping** module to the **IoTHub** module. It also ensures that all messages are logged by the **Logger** module.

        { "source" : "mapping", "sink" : "IotHub" }
    ]
}
```

Save the changes you made to the configuration file.

To run the sample:

1. At a command prompt, navigate to the **build** folder in your local copy of the **iot-edge** repository.
2. Run the following command:
   
    ```cmd
    samples\simulated_device_cloud_upload\Debug\simulated_device_cloud_upload_sample.exe ..\samples\simulated_device_cloud_upload\src\simulated_device_cloud_upload_win.json
    ```
3. You can use the [device explorer][lnk-device-explorer] or [iothub-explorer][lnk-iothub-explorer] tool to monitor the messages that IoT hub receives from the gateway. For example, using iothub-explorer you can monitor device-to-cloud messages using the following command:

    ```cmd
    iothub-explorer monitor-events --login "HostName={Your iot hub name}.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey={Your IoT Hub key}"
    ```
